Constructor - constructor which is run during creation of the contract and cannot be called afterwards. It permanently stores the address of the person creating the contract:
Mapping types have to be declared using mapping(_KeyType => _ValueType).  In this example _KeyType may be nearly any type except for a mapping, a dynamic array, an enum, a contract and a struct. _ValueType , on the other hand, can actually be any type Solidity provides, including mappings.
