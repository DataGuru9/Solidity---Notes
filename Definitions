Constructor - constructor which is run during creation of the contract and cannot be called afterwards. It permanently stores the address of the person creating the contract:
Mapping types have to be declared using mapping(_KeyType => _ValueType). Mappings can be used for state variables only . In this example _KeyType may be nearly any type except for a mapping, a dynamic array, an enum, a contract and a struct. _ValueType , on the other hand, can actually be any type Solidity provides, including mappings.
'NEW' keyword actually deploy and creates a new contract instance, it initializes the contract instance by deploying the contract, initializing the state variables, and running he constructor and setting the nonce value to one and returns the address of the instance to the caller.
