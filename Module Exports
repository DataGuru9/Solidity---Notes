Suppose there is a file Hello.js which include two functions

sayHelloInEnglish = function() {
  return "Hello";
};
sayHelloInSpanish = function() {
  return "Hola";
};
We write a function only when utility of the code is more than one call.

Suppose we want to increase utility of the function to a different file say World.js,in this case exporting a file comes into picture which can be obtained by module.exports.

You can just export both the function by the code given below

var anyVariable={
 sayHelloInEnglish = function() {
      return "Hello";
    };
  sayHelloInSpanish = function() {
      return "Hola";
    }; 
}
module.export=anyVariable;
Now you just need to require the file name into World.js inorder to use those functions

var world= require("./hello.js");
